  "附錄 B：根據任務能力之範例引導語 醫學知識：應用基礎科學概念 基礎科學包含需要理解和應用基本科學原理以回答問題的內容。基礎科學問題不應僅憑臨床知識或模式識別（例如，提供一份症狀清單並詢問應開什麼藥）來回答。這些問題應需要臨床知識，以及在預臨床教育中可能學到的、並在臨床輪轉中強化的一項或多項基礎科學原理。",
  "APPENDIX B: SAMPLE LEAD-INS BASED ON TASK COMPETENCIES Medical Knowledge: Applying Foundational Science Concepts Foundational (basic) science comprises items that require understanding and application of basic science principles to answer the question. Foundational science items should not be answerable based simply on clinical knowledge alone or on pattern recognition (eg, providing a list of symptoms and asking what drug to prescribe). These items should require clinical knowledge and also knowledge of one or more foundational science principles that would have likely been learned in preclinical education and hopefully reinforced during clinical rotations.\n"
