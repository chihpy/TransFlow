# Human Development
## Normal age-related findings and care of the well patient
### Infancy and childhood (0–12 years)
#### Normal physical changes: linear growth, variations in linear growth, including constitutional delay; weight; head circumference; micturition, defecation, primary incontinence/bedwetting; normal physical examination; screening; sleep; teething syndrome
#### Developmental stages: motor; speech; cognitive; psychosocial; anticipatory guidance
#### Lifestyle and routine preventive health care: nutrition; exercise (eg, benefits of exercise); preventive/travel medicine; risk factors and prevention (eg, guns, swimming, motor vehicles, car seats); routine vaccinations; adaptive behavioral responses to stress and illness (eg, coping mechanisms); patient adherence
### Adolescence (13–17 years)
#### Normal physical changes: linear growth, variations in linear growth including constitutional delay; weight; puberty; normal physical examination; gynecomastia; autonomy/self-identity; sleep
#### Developmental stages: cognitive (eg, abstract thought); psychosocial (eg, autonomy, role confusion, sexual identity); anticipatory guidance
#### Lifestyle and routine preventive health care: nutrition; exercise (eg, benefits of exercise); preventive/travel medicine; risk factors and prevention (eg, risk-taking behavior, helmets, motor vehicles, seat belts, distractions; safe sex, consent and screening for reproductive and sexual coercion); routine vaccinations; adaptive behavioral responses to stress and illness (eg, coping mechanisms); patient adherence
### Adulthood (18–64 years)
#### Normal physical changes: weight; normal physical examination; screening; sleep
#### Developmental stages: cognitive; intimacy vs isolation; anticipatory guidance
#### Lifestyle and routine preventive health care: nutrition; exercise (eg, benefits of exercise); preventive/travel medicine; risk factors and prevention; routine vaccinations; adaptive behavioral responses to stress and illness (eg, coping mechanisms); patient adherence
### Older Adulthood (65 years and older)
#### Normal physical changes, including normal physical exam for age: weight, height (spinal compression), skin, bruising; normal physical examination; response to temperature; micturition, defecation; sleep
#### Developmental stages: motor; cognitive (eg, changes associated with normal aging); psychosocial; integrity vs despair; retrospection; anticipatory guidance
#### Lifestyle and routine preventive health care: nutrition; exercise (eg, benefits of exercise); preventive/travel medicine; risk factors and prevention (eg, falls, general medical condition; polypharmacy, driving, caregiver stress); routine vaccinations
