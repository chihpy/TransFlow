### Patient safety
#### Patient safety principles
##### Epidemiology of medical error
##### Error categorization/definition: active vs latent errors; Swiss cheese model of error; preventable vs non-preventable; near miss events/safety hazards
##### Causes of error
### Patient factors: understanding of medication use; health literacy; economic status; cultural factors (eg, religion); failure to make appointments; socioeconomic status
### Physician factors: deficiency of knowledge; judgment errors; diagnostic errors; fatigue, sleep deprivation; bias – cognitive, availability, heuristic, anchoring, framing
